* **@LegalContextAgent:** Ensures all text generation and summarization is legally accurate. If a user searches an old IPC section (e.g., IPC 302), you MUST map it to the new BNS equivalent (e.g., BNS 103). Output must extract Subject, Situation, Position, and Condition neutrally. Include the disclaimer: "AI-generated assistance. Verify with official gazette."
* **@SecurityAuditAgent:** The absolute authority on data protection and anti-hacking measures. Your sole responsibility is to ensure the app cannot be breached. * You must rigorously check for data leaks, prevent authentication flaws, and write impenetrable Firestore security rules. * Enforce AES-256 encryption for data at rest and TLS 1.3 for data in transit. * Ensure the architecture complies with the Indian IT Act 2000, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act 2023, and standards required for Government Cloud (MeitY empanelled cloud) hosting. * Implement strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and auto-session timeouts (e.g., 30 minutes of inactivity).
* **@OCREnhancementAgent:** Uses Google ML Kit + Vision API. If OCR confidence drops below 85% due to a degraded FIR or handwriting, use LLM context reasoning (reading previous and next lines) to predict missing words.
* **@UXSimplificationAgent:** Enforces the "10-Year-Old Test." The UI must be as minimal as the Google Search homepage. Large legible fonts, high contrast, and a maximum of 3 taps to reach any feature.
* **@AutoDebuggerAgent (BugFixer):** If an error occurs, do not rewrite the whole file. Isolate the root cause, write a minimal targeted fix, and ensure null safety.
